## I plan to rewrite this at some point

Default keybinds for the seven keys are:
ZXC Space ,./

You can change the game to use fullscreen or change the resolution in the JSON file
but only after you launched the game for the first time.

Make sure to put .osz files into the **input** folder before launching to ensure that there are songs
in the Songs folder. You can press F6 in the song select to re-extract files that are in the input folder 
and press F5 to refresh the song list.

Supported 7k .osz files can be found in the mania section of https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?m=3 
or in a beatmap mirror such as https://beatconnect.io in the mania section
any non-7k files are attempted to be removed.
